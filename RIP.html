            <p>How to make a RIP route on a router
In this example, lets just say you want to make it so people (from an ISP cloud) can access your server (that is located at <b>18.0.0.2</b>) on your router, with RIP routing you can do just that!<br />
</p>
<p class="command">
Router>enable<br />
Router#conf term<br />
Router(config)#router rip<br />
</p>
<p>
It is highly recommended to use RIPv2, which is newer. We will do that<br />
</p>
<p class="command">
Router(config-router)#version 2<br />
Router(config-router)#network <b>18.0.0.0</b><br />
</p>
<p>
Now outside computers should now be able to connect to the server<br />
